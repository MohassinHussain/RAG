The internet began as a research project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s. 
Known as ARPANET, it connected several universities to share information digitally. 
By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was developed by Tim Berners-Lee, making it possible 
for anyone to publish and access content through browsers. Today, the internet is a global 
system linking billions of devices and enabling services like email, cloud computing, and social media.
