Renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, rain, 
and geothermal heat. Solar power uses photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, while 
wind turbines transform wind energy into power. These sources are increasingly important as the world 
moves away from fossil fuels to combat climate change. However, challenges remain in energy 
storage and grid integration.
